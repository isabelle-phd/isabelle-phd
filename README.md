**`Phd Candidate`**

I am a Social Sciences PhD candidate from Brazil, funded by the [São Paulo Research Foundation](https://fapesp.br/en). My research focuses on the comparative diffusion of constitutional rights and is conducted at the [DataCons Lab](https://datacons.com.br/) at [São Paulo State University](https://www2.unesp.br/). Here I document my journey in data analysis, including practical exercises and projects developed throughout my doctoral training. I also bring prior professional and research experience in human rights, sustainability, and public policy.
